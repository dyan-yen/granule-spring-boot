# granule-spring-boot
A demo site for how to use Granule in a Spring Boot web application.

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/granule/">Granule</a> helps compress CSS and JavaScript files, but it requires another Servlet. We need to do some tweaks to the web project when using Spring Boot.

The code is based on <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-tomcat-jsp
">spring-boot-sample-tomcat-jsp</a>.
